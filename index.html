    <p>If you spend time in Maven, then you're probably using Java or at least significant parts of the Java platform,
      and you're probably familiar with builds that take a while to run.  If your build takes longer than a few seconds
      to run, then you probably find something else to do while your build runs.  You could check your email, catch
      up on your RSS feeds, play a casual game, or do something else.  This has <a href="http://xkcd.com/303/">its merits</a>, 
      but it tends to disrupt your flow.  Worse still, if your build fails quickly, you might not realize it because you
      won't even return to check on it 'til you imagine that it might have finished.  Accordingly, it's helpful to have
      something let you know that the build is complete, or has failed, as soon as possible.</p>
